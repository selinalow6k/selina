Using Creative Commons Public Licenses 

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and 
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share 
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright 
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The 
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not 
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. 

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are 
intended for use by those authorized to give the public 
permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by 
copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are 
irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms 
and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. 
Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before 
applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the 
material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any 
material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- 
licensed material, or material used under an exception or 
limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public 
licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the 
licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If 
the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for 
example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to 
copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our 
licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain 
other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of 
the licensed material may still be restricted for other 
reasons, including because others have copyright or other 
rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, 
such as asking that all changes be marked or described. 
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to 
51      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

59 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree 
60 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons 
61 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the 
62 extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are 
63 granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of 
64 these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in 
65 consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the 
66 Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

69 Section 1 -- Definitions. 
70 
 
71   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar 
72      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material

74      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring 
75      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the 
76      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed 
77      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, 
78      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is 
79      synched in timed relation with a moving image. 
80 
 
81   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright 
82      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in

86      closely related to copyright including, without limitation, 
87      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database

89      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights 
90      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar 
91      Rights. 
92 
 
93   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the 
94      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws 
95      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright 
96      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international 
97      agreements. 
98 
 
99   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or

108      terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to

117      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, 
118      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material 
119      available to the public including in ways that members of the 
120      public may access the material from a place and at a time 
121      individually chosen by them. 
122 
 
123   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright 
124      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of 
125      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, 
126      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially 
127      equivalent rights anywhere in the world. 
128 
 
129   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights 
130      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. 
131 
 
132 
 
133 Section 2 -- Scope. 
134 
 
135   a. License grant. 
136 
 
137        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, 
138           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
139           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to 
140           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: 
141 
 
142             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or 
143                in part; and 
144 
 
145             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 
146 
 
147        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where 
148           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public 
149           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with 
150           its terms and conditions. 
151 
 
152        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 
153           6(a). 
154 
 
155        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The 
156           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in 
157           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, 
158           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The 
159           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or 
160           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications 
161           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including 
162           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective 
163           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, 
164           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) 
165           (4) never produces Adapted Material. 
166 
 
167        5. Downstream recipients. 
168 
 
169             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every 
170                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically 
171                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the 
172                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this 
173                Public License. 
174 
 
175             b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose 
176                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or 
177                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the 
178                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the 
179                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed 
180                Material. 
181 
 
182        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or 
183           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You 
184           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected 
185           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, 
186           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as 
187           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). 
188 
 
189   b. Other rights. 
190 
 
191        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not 
192           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, 
193           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to 
194           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to 
195           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited 
196           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed 
197           Rights, but not otherwise. 
198 
 
199        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this 
200           Public License. 
201 
 
202        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to 
203           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed 
204           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society 
205           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory 
206           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly 
207           reserves any right to collect such royalties. 
208 
 
209 
 
210 Section 3 -- License Conditions. 
211 
 
212 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the 
213 following conditions. 
214 
 
215   a. Attribution. 
216 
 
217        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified 
218           form), You must: 
219 
 
220             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor 
221                with the Licensed Material: 
222 
 
223                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed 
224                     Material and any others designated to receive 
225                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by 
226                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if 
227                     designated); 
228 
 
229                 ii. a copyright notice; 
230 
 
231                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; 
232 
 
233                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of 
234                     warranties; 
235 
 
236                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the 
237                     extent reasonably practicable; 
238 
 
239             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and 
240                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and 
241 
 
242             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this 
243                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or 
244                hyperlink to, this Public License. 
245 
 
246        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any 
247           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in 
248           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be 
249           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or 
250           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
251           information. 
252 
 
253        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the 
254           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent 
255           reasonably practicable. 
256 
 
257        4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's 
258           License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted 
259           Material from complying with this Public License. 
260 
 
261 
 
262 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. 
263 
 
264 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that 
265 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: 
266 
 
267   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right 
268      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial 
269      portion of the contents of the database; 
270 
 
271   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database 
272      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database 
273      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database 
274      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and 
275 
 
276   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share 
277      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. 
278 
 
279 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not 
280 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed 
281 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. 
282 
 
283 
 
284 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. 
285 
 
286   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE 
287      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS 
288      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF 
289      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, 
290      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
291      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
292      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, 
293      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT 
294      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT 
295      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
296 
 
297   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE 
298      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
299      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, 
300      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, 
301      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR 
302      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
303      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR 
304      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR 
305      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
306 
 
307   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided 
308      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent 
309      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and 
310      waiver of all liability. 
311 
 
312 
 
313 Section 6 -- Term and Termination. 
314 
 
315   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and 
316      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with 
317      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License 
318      terminate automatically. 
319 
 
320   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under 
321      Section 6(a), it reinstates: 
322 
 
323        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided 
324           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the 
325           violation; or 
326 
 
327        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. 
328 
 
329      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any 
330      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations 
331      of this Public License. 
332 
 
333   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the 
334      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop 
335      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so 
336      will not terminate this Public License. 
337 
 
338   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public 
339      License. 
340 
 
341 
 
342 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. 
343 
 
344   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different 
345      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. 
346 
 
347   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the 
348      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and 
349      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. 
350 
 
351 
 
352 Section 8 -- Interpretation. 
353 
 
354   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and 
355      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose 
356      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully 
357      be made without permission under this Public License. 
358 
 
359   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is 
360      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the 
361      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision 
362      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License 
363      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and 
364      conditions. 
365 
 
366   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no 
367      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the 
368      Licensor. 
369 
 
370   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted 
371      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities 
372      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal 
373      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
